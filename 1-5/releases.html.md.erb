### Upgrading from 1.2.0
It is unfortunately **not** possible to upgrade from any prior versions to this tile version or greater.
E.g. from 1.2.0 to 1.3.2.1

This is because tile versions 1.2.0 and earlier use v1 of the Services API, whilst all newer tiles use v2.
The migration between the versions would have being risky and complicated due to the way RabbitMQ was using service names, therefore the decision was taken to not support tile upgrades.

We always aim for tiles to be upgradeable from previous versions where possible.

### Options
We recommend the following:

* Backup any persisted data (if required)
* Stop any applications / services that are publishing to the queues
* Delete the existing 1.2.0 tile
* Deploy the >= 1.3.2.1 tile version
* Restore any data
* Restage any applications to refresh the binding information, as the IPs may have changed
