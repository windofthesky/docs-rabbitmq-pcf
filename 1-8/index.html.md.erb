This guide describes setting up and using RabbitMQ&reg; for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF). RabbitMQ enables messaging between cloud-based servers, apps and devices.

## <a id='AboutTile'></a>About RabbitMQ for PCF

RabbitMQ for PCF software services enable PCF app developers to use the RabbitMQ messaging service in their apps. Operators install the services using PCF Operations Manager (Ops Manager) and publish them to the Marketplace. App developers can then create instances of the services to call from their apps. 

RabbitMQ for PCF v1.8 supports two types of service, an *on-demand* service and a *pre-provisioned* service. This table summarizes the main differences between the two:

<table id='rabbit-odb-vs-pre' border="1" class="nice"><tr>
   <th></th>
   <th>Available Since</th>
   <th>VMs it Runs On</th>
   <th>How VMs are Created</th>
   <th>Metrics Name Prefix</th>
   </tr><tr>
   <th>On-Demand Service</th>
   <td>New for v1.8</td>
   <td>Dedicated VM that serves a single service instance</td>
   <td>PCF creates each VM on-demand when app developer creates service instance</td>
   <td><code>p.rabbit</code> (with a dot)</td>
   </tr><tr>
   <th>Pre-Provisioned Service</th>
   <td>v1.2</td>
   <td>Multi-tenant VMs shared by apps across PCF deployment</td>
   <td>PCF creates all VMs when operator deploys or updates service</td>
   <td><code>p-rabbit</code> (with a dash)</td>
   </tr>
</table>

This RabbitMQ for PCF v1.8 documentation describes both service types. Documentation for RabbitMQ for PCF v1.7 and earlier only describes a pre-provisioned service.

## <a id='AboutRabbit'></a>About RabbitMQ

RabbitMQ is a fast and dependable open-source message server, which supports a wide range of use cases 
including reliable integration, content based routing and global data delivery, and high volume monitoring and data ingestion.

Emerging as the de facto standard for cloud messaging, RabbitMQ is used for efficient communication 
between servers, applications and devices, and creates lasting value by enabling rapid development of modern decentralized 
application and data architectures that can scale with your business needs.
