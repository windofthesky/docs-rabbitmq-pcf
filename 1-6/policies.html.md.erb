# RabbitMQ Policy

An example policy is configured in OpsManager but not enabled.

You should configure the policy to suit your own deployment. The example in the "Policy for new instances" textarea is given as guidance of how to format the configuration.

The following rules apply:

* The policy is only applied to new instances
* Any existing instances will not have the policy applied
* The policy can be updated in OpsManager and this will only be applied to any new instances created there after
* The policy can only be deleted manually from the RabbitMQ nodes

## Viewing or changing the policy
In OpsManager on the RabbitMQ tile, there is a left hand menu item called `RabbitMQ Policy`

<%= image_tag("images/policy_opsman.jpeg") %>

The policy must be valid JSON and it should use valid RabbitMQ policy criteria.
This is not validated during the deployment, so any errors could either cause the deployment to fail or policies to not be applied correctly.

For more information, view [RabbitMQ Policies](http://www.rabbitmq.com/parameters.html#policies).

## RabbitMQ dashboard

You can view the policy on the RabbitMQ Dashboard. The URL can be obtained from your `VCAP_SERVICES` for application developers.

The policy is applied to all queues, with a rank of 50 so it can be overriden by defining your own policy with a higher rank.

You can see any new queues created have the policy automatically applied.

## Network partition behavior

It is possible to change how you would want RabbitMQ to act once it discovers there has been a network partition.  The two options are `pause_minority` and `autoheal`, and more detail on these settings can be found here: https://www.rabbitmq.com/partitions.html

You must set the choose the option you want before deploying, or the default `pause_minority` will be used.
