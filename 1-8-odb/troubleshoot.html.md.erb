### <a id="create-instance"></a> Instance Creation Errors

The following sections describe errors that occur when a developer tries to create an on-demand instance of the RabbitMQ for PCF service.

### create-instance

<table border='1' class='nice'>
<tr>
  <th width="22%">Error</th>
  <td>Developers cannot create instances of on-demand services. Errors they may report include:<br>
  <code>TK cannot create instance GUID TASK-ID</code><br>
  <code>TK cannot create instance GUID TASK-ID</code>
 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>Cause</th>
  <td>BOSH fails when trying to create a new VM</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>Solution</th>
  <td>
    Any <code>create-instance</code>error a developer receives should include the BOSH Task ID for the instance creation job and the GUID of the half-created service instance. If the developer does not supply these, follow the instructions <a href="#determine-guid">Determine the Task ID and GUID of an Instance</a>.

    <ol><li>
      Run <code>bosh task TASK-ID</code> to show any instance creation task errors from BOSH. Possible errors include failure at the IaaS level and hitting your rate limit for the day.
    </li><li>
      If the BOSH task completed successfully, the problem was elsewhere. Set up a trace in your logging platform or search your syslog for the service instance GUID. This generates a series of log messages that tracks how far the instance creation request got.
    </li><li>
      Refer to the [Create Service Instance](https://docs.pivotal.io/on-demand-service-broker/concepts.html#create-service-instance) sequence diagram to see how PCF components create a service instance. Compare this successful sequence of component actions and messages with the trace from your logging platform.
    </li><li>
      To zero in on a specific failed component or unreceived message, test half of the sequence at a time and find out which half failed, then continue dividing in half and testing.

## <a id="techniques"></a> Techniques


### <a id="determine-guid"></a> Determine the Task ID and GUID of an Instance

When debugging an instance of the on-demand RabbitMQ for PCF service, the following two identifiers are useful:

* The Task ID for the BOSH task that creates the service instance
* The GUID of instance that was not successfully created

This procedure retrieves these two values if you only know the service name and the org and space containing the instance.

1. Use the cf CLI to target and to log in to your deployment. See [Login](../cf-cli/getting-started.html#login) the *Getting Started with the cf CLI* topic.
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf login -a https<span>://</span>api.example.com -u username<span>@</span>example.com
    API endpoint: https<span>://</span>api.example.com
    </pre>

1. Follow the directions to [SSH into Ops Manager](/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#ssh) in the *Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI* topic. Use the following values:

    * **Certificate Location**: Use the file path on your local machine to the key pair used to install Ops Manager.
    * **BOSH Director IP Address**: Retrieve from the Ops Manager Director tile **Status** tab.
    * **BOSH Director Credentials**: Retrieve from the Ops Manager API or find it in the Ops Man Director tile **Credentials** tab > **Director Credentials**.

1. Continue following the *Advanced Troubleshooting* directions to [Log into BOSH](/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#log-in). 

1. From the Ops Manager Director VM you can now use the BOSH CLI to retrieve information about service instances from the BOSH Director VM.
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ bosh --ca-cert CERTIFICATE-LOCATON target BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP
    </pre>

1. Log into the space containing the instance or failed instance. 
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf login
    </pre>

1. Run `cf services` to see a listing of

cf services - only one line on each

cf service SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME # more info on specific instance

bosh tasks recent

cf service SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME --guid # to get GUID of instance

bosh tasks recent | grep GUID # first column gives you TASK-ID # for instance

bosh task TASK-ID # shows full error message

bosh task TASK-ID --raw # shows raw JSON of error
