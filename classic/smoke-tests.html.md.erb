RabbitMQ for PCF runs a set of smoke tests during installation to confirm system health.

### Smoke Test Steps

The smoke tests perform the following for each available service plan:

1. Targets the org <code>system</code> and creates a space to run the tests.
1. Deploys an instance of the [CF RabbitMQ Example App](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/rabbit-example-app) to this space
1. Creates a RabbitMQ service instance and binds it to the CF RabbitMQ Example App
1. Checks that the CF RabbitMQ Example App can write to and read from the RabbitMQ service instance
1. Cleans up all deployed application and all its service bindings. Finally, the cf space is deleted.


### Troubleshooting

If errors occur while the smoke tests run, they will be summarised at the end of the errand log output.
Detailed logs can be found where the failure occurs.

When encountering an error when running smoke tests, it can be helpful to search the log for other instances
of the error summary printed at the end of the tests, e.g. <code>Failed to target Cloud Foundry</code>.
Lookout for <code>TIP: ...</code> in the logs next to any error output for further troubleshooting hints.
