<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Pre-released DRAFT documentation. </p>
This guide describes setting up and using RabbitMQ&reg; for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) as an on-demand service. RabbitMQ enables messaging between cloud-based servers, apps and devices.

For information about using RabbitMQ for PCF as a pre-provisioned service, 
see [RabbitMQ for PCF (Pre-Provisioned)](http://docs-pcf-staging.cfapps.io/rabbitmq-cf-d34379b0-a290-47c7-bc6c-c45a9adfa8c7/).

## <a id='AboutTile'></a>About RabbitMQ for PCF

RabbitMQ for PCF is a line of two software services that enable PCF app developers to use the RabbitMQ messaging service in their apps. Operators install the services using PCF Operations Manager (Ops Manager) and publish them to the Marketplace. App developers can then create instances of the service to call from their apps. 

Pivotal Network distributes two versions of RabbitMQ for PCF, the *on-demand* service and the *pre-provisioned* service. This table summarizes the main differences between the two:

<table id='rabbit-odb-vs-pre' border="1" class="nice"><tr>
   <th></th>
   <th>Available Since</th>
   <th>VMs it Runs On</th>
   <th>How VMs are Created</th>
   <th>Metrics Name Prefix</th>
   </tr><tr>
   <th>On-Demand Service</th>
   <td>New for v1.8</td>
   <td>Dedicated VM that serves a single service instance</td>
   <td>PCF creates each VM on-demand when app developer creates service instance</td>
   <td><code>p.rabbit</code> (with a dot)</td>
   </tr><tr>
   <th>Pre-Provisioned Service</th>
   <td>v1.2</td>
   <td>Multi-tenant VMs shared by apps across PCF deployment</td>
   <td>PCF creates all VMs when operator deploys or updates service</td>
   <td><code>p-rabbit</code> (with a dash)</td>
   </tr>
</table>

This v1.8+ documentation describes on-demand RabbitMQ for PCF. For documentation on the pre-provisioned service, see 
[RabbitMQ for Pivotal Cloud Foundry Documentation](https://docs.pivotal.io/rabbitmq-cf-d34379b0-a290-47c7-bc6c-c45a9adfa8c7/index.html) 
or select `v1.7.10` or earlier in the dropdown menu above. 

## <a id='AboutRabbit'></a>About RabbitMQ

RabbitMQ is a fast and dependable open-source message server, which supports a wide range of use cases 
including reliable integration, content based routing and global data delivery, and high volume monitoring and data ingestion.

Emerging as the de facto standard for cloud messaging, RabbitMQ is used for efficient communication 
between servers, applications and devices, and creates lasting value by enabling rapid development of modern decentralized 
application and data architectures that can scale with your business needs.
