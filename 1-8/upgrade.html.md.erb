# Upgrades

This product enables automated upgrades between versions of the product and is deployed through Ops Manager, and due to RabbitMQ product limitations may require the cluster to be taken offline.  When this is necessary it is clearly noted in the release notes for that version.

Note there is a difference between the cluster remaining available during a tile upgrade/update, and an individual queue placed on nodes in a cluster.
The upgrade paths are detailed [here](http://docs.pivotal.io/rabbitmq-cf/index.html) for each released version.

A reference guide for deployments is shown the table below.  Please be aware that this is a guide only and that the release notes for the version you are updating to must be checked before upgrading.

To upgrade the product:

* The Operator should download the latest version of the product from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-rabbitmq-service)
* Upload the new .pivotal file to Ops Manager
* Upload the stemcell associated with the update (*if required*)
* Update any new mandatory configuration parameters (*if required*)
* Press "Apply changes" and the rest of the process is automated

Depending on the network partition handling that you have configured and the
resource config, you should benefit from the product's stemcell rolling
upgrades. The default HAProxy instance count has changed from 1 to 2 and the
RabbitMQ node count from 2 to 3. This is required for rolling stemcell
upgrades. This is the minimum deployment size that we recommend for the default
`pause_minority` RabbitMQ network partition behaviour. See [Clustering and
Network Partitions](./partitions.html) for more information.

Only when upgrading between specific versions of Erlang or RabbitMQ will the
cluster become unavailable. This will be clearly stated on the release notes for
that version, should this be the case.

The length of the downtime depends on whether there is a stemcell update to
replace the operating system image or whether the existing VM can simply have
the RabbitMQ software updated. Stemcell updates incur additional downtime while
the IaaS creates the new VM.

Ops Manager ensures the instances are updated with the new packages and any
configuration changes are applied automatically.

Upgrading to a newer version of the product should not cause any loss of data or
configuration.

Please note that it may take busy RabbitMQ nodes a long time to shutdown during
the upgrade and this process must not be interrupted.

For any issues upgrading RabbitMQ, please refer to the
[Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.html) section.

### What do I need to do before upgrading to a newer version of RabbitMQ or Erlang?
Ensure the cluster is healthy via the RabbitMQ Management UI. You cannot rely
on the `bosh instances` output, that reflects the state of Erlang VM, not
RabbitMQ.

## Why do I want to stop RabbitMQ?
We have to stop RabbitMQ when we are upgrading RabbitMQ package or Erlang VM
version.

## Release policy

When a new version of RabbitMQ is released we aim to release a new version of
the product containing this soon after.

Where there is a new version of RabbitMQ or another dependent software
component such as the stemcell released due to a critical CVE, Pivotal's goal
is to release a new version of the product within 48 hours.
