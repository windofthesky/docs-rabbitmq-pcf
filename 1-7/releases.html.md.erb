Release notes for [RabbitMQ for Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-rabbitmq-service)

Upgrades are normally a rolling deployment unless otherwise noted below.

Consider the following compatibility information before upgrading RabbitMQ for PCF.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Any tile upgrading to RabbitMQ v3.6.6 or later will require downtime as the RabbitMQ cluster cannot run in mixed-mode with versions lower than v3.6.6. </p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Pivotal recommends that customers always upgrade to the latest patch version of their minor line, and then only upgrade to the latest available new minor patch.  This is to ensure that RabbitMQ or Erlang versions are not downgraded during the process.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You can only upgrade to v1.7.x from v1.6.5 or later.  This must be completed before upgrading from Ops Manager v1.7x to v1.8.x.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Customers with v1.6.6 of the tile can upgrade to v1.7.0 or later.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Customers with v1.6.7â€“9 of the tile should only upgrade to v1.7.4 or later.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Customers with v1.6.10 or later of the tile should only upgrade to v1.7.7 or later.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Customers upgrading from v1.5.x to v1.6.x should ensure that they are not upgrading from the latest v1.5.x patch version, and should only go to the latest v1.6.x patch.</p>

### Upgrading from v1.2.0
It is unfortunately **not** possible to upgrade from any prior versions to this tile version or later.
E.g. from v1.2.0 to v1.3.2.1

This is because tile versions v1.2.0 and earlier use v1 of the Services API, whilst all newer tiles use v2.
The migration between the versions would have being risky and complicated due to the way RabbitMQ was using service names, therefore the decision was taken to not support tile upgrades.

We always aim for tiles to be upgradeable from previous versions where possible.

### Options
Pivotal recommends the following:

* Backup any persisted data (if required)
* Stop any applications / services that are publishing to the queues
* Delete the existing v1.2.0 tile
* Deploy the >= v1.3.2.1 tile version
* Restore any data
* Restage any applications to refresh the binding information, as the IPs may have changed
