## RabbitMQ Management Dashboard

### Admin User

To gain access to the management dashboard as the `admin` user, visit http://pivotal-rabbitmq.your.cf.installation.com

The username and password is the username and password you provided in the RabbitMQ configuration in OpsManager, which is also shown in the Credentials tab.

### Application Developer

Users of Cloud Foundry who create instances via the Apps Manager, or the <code>cf</code> CLI also get access to the Management UI. This is done using credentials that provide access only to their particular <strong>vhost</strong>.

The appropriate URL is accessible via the Manage button within the Apps Manager.

<%= image_tag("images/console_manage.jpeg") %>

Or it is also injected into the <code>VCAP_SERVICES</code> environment variable provided to apps running on Cloud Foundry.
This can also be found via the CLI using `cf env <your app name>`.

## Logging

A TCP Syslog endpoint can be configured in OpsManager. Logs are currently only forwarded for the RabbitMQ cluster.

## RabbitMQ CLI

If you wish to run commands such as <code>rabbitmqctl</code> then you have two options:

SSH into one of the machines running the rabbitmq-server. IPs can be found from the Status tab and access credentials from the Credentials tab within the RabbitMQ component of the installer. From there you need to bring RabbitMQ and Erlang into your environment and from there you can use <code>rabbitmqctl</code>:

<pre><code>
bash-4.1# export PATH=$PATH:/var/vcap/packages/rabbitmq-server/bin
bash-4.1# export PATH=$PATH:/var/vcap/packages/erlang/bin
bash-4.1# rabbitmqctl cluster_status
Cluster status of node rabbit@node0 ...
[{nodes,[{disc,[rabbit@node0,rabbit@node1,rabbit@node2,rabbit@node3]}]},
 {running_nodes,[rabbit@node3,rabbit@node2,rabbit@node1,rabbit@node0]},
 {partitions,[]}]
...done.
</code></pre>

Alternatively, install RabbitMQ and Erlang on a machine of your choice. Be sure to match versions of both to the cluster: the Management UI shows both the version of RabbitMQ and Erlang.

Then set your <code>~/.erlang.cookie</code> to match the cookie used in the cluster (you may have supplied this as part of the installation; see above).

You'll need to set up your <code>/etc/hosts</code> file to match the RabbitMQ nodes.

## HAProxy Statistics
The HAProxy statistics page can be viewed at the IP address for the HAProxy node.

This page is only accessible via the internal IP address, so access will be required to your PCF network.

Identify the IP address of the HAProxy from the `Status` page in OpsManager for the RabbitMQ tile
<%= image_tag("images/opsman_status.jpeg") %>
Here, this is 10.0.0.55

Identify the credentials for the HAProxy job, from the `Credentials` page in OpsManager
<%= image_tag("images/opsman_credentials.jpeg") %>

Visit http://10.0.0.55 and input the username & password to view the dashboard.

If you have got multiple HAProxys then there will be separate dashboards on each IP.
