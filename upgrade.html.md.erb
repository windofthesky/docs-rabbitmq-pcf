_This topic provides the upgrade path information and instructions on how to upgrade the product._

_Example:_
This version of Pivotal GemFire for PCF supports upgrading from all the previous versions of the product. Running service instances are automatically upgraded one node at a time. If you configured your clusters with data redundancy, then the upgrade process requires no downtime and results in no data loss.
Note: Upgrades from Alpha or Beta versions of the software are not supported.

## <a id="path"></a> Upgrade Path

_Outline the upgrade route from any previous version to the current. This can be a table listing which versions of Ops Manager support which product version upgrades. For example:_

<table border="1" class="nice">
<tr>
  <th rowspan="2">Elastic Runtime Version</th>
  <th colspan="2">Supported Upgrades from SSO Versions</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>From</th>
  <th>To</th>
</tr><tr>
  <th rowspan="1">1.6.x</th>
  <td>1.0.1-1.0.14</td>
  <td rowspan="1">1.0.15</td>
</tr><tr>
  <th rowspan="2">1.7.x</th>
  <td>1.0.1-1.0.15</td>
  <td rowspan="2">1.1.1</td>
</tr><tr>
  <td>1.1.0</td>
</tr>
</table>

_Other examples of tables used for the Upgrade Path:_

* [App Distribution](http://docs.pivotal.io/app-dist/index.html)
* [RabbitMQ for PCF](http://docs.pivotal.io/rabbitmq-cf/index.html) for an example of a complicated upgrade path.


_For simpler cases, when the upgrade path is identical to the installation procedure, you can write a mini-procedure like this:_

Follow the [Install My Service](./install-config.html) procedure to upgrade.


## <a id="prepare"></a> Preparing to Upgrade (if procedures) or Prerequisites for Upgrading (if just a list)

_body text_

## <a id="upgrade"></a>Upgrade to the Latest Version

_body text_

## <a id="config-check"></a> Configuration Check

_Any configuration changes required after upgrading._

## <a id="policy"></a> Release Policy

_Optional, see example below._

Where there is a new version of RabbitMQ or another dependent software component, such as the stemcell released due to a critical CVE, Pivotalâ€™s goal is to release a new version of the product within 48 hours.
