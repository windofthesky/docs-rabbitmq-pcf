_This page covers conceptual information about the product. If your service is simple, and the Overview section on the [landing page](./index.html) gives enough information for readers to develop a useful mental model of how it works, you can skip this page. But most services will need additional high-level information on this page for new users to be successful._

_The Overview page in some documentation performs the same function as this About page. For example, see the [Pivotal HD documentation](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalhd-ds/overview.html)_

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: <em>Only include on this page information that the reader needs to understand, not instructions that the reader needs to follow.</em></p>

_Introductory text: Provide a sentence or two to introduce and describe this topic. Example:_

This topic describes My Service in detail. If you are new to the product, read this page to learn how it works. 

_Use this page as needed to explain how the product works. This is a great place for diagrams. Use PNG format for diagrams and images; if you have source files for diagrams, please provide those too._

_Distinguish clearly between the fundamental **objects** that the service operates on, such as users, apps, logs, addresses, groups, accounts, etc.; and the software **components**, the internal parts of the service that create, destroy, and do things to these objects, pass them around, and interface with CF and other systems._
